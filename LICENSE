    (a) Any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish, or otherwise make
        available to third parties MUST be distributed under this License,
        in its entirety and without modification.

    (b) You may NOT remove, replace, relicense, or sublicense Derivative
        Works under any other license, including more permissive or more
        restrictive open-source licenses, proprietary licenses, or any
        license that does not incorporate all conditions of this License.

    (c) Any attempt to distribute a Derivative Work under a different license
        automatically terminates all rights granted to you under this License.

    (d) You must retain, in all copies and substantial portions of the

    (b) A reference to the canonical location of this License
        (https://github.com/DeltaRule/DeltaDatabase/blob/main/LICENSE); and

        original Software.

3.3 No Misrepresentation.

    You may not claim that a Derivative Work is the original Software or
    that it was created by the original authors.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 4 — ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The rights granted in Section 2 are available ONLY to Licensees who satisfy
ALL of the following eligibility requirements. An individual who is not acting
on behalf of a legal entity (i.e., personal, non-commercial use) is exempt
from requirements 4.2 and 4.3.

4.1 Absence of Restricted Funding.

    (a) The Licensee must not be a Restricted Government or Funding Source
        as defined in Section 1.6.

    (b) The Licensee must not have received, in the twelve (12) months
        immediately preceding the date of first use of the Software, more
        than twenty-five percent (25%) of its total operating funding,
        equity investment, grant funding, or any other form of financial
        support from any Restricted Government or Funding Source.

    (c) Any Licensee that becomes ineligible under this section after
        commencing use of the Software must cease all use, distribution,
        and modification of the Software and any Derivative Works within
        ninety (90) days of becoming ineligible.

4.2 Charitable Contribution Requirement.

    (a) To use the Software for any Commercial Use, the Licensee (or its
        parent or controlling entity) must have made a cumulative donation
        of no less than five hundred United States dollars (USD $500) — or
        the equivalent in another currency at the time of donation — to
        one or more Qualifying Charities.

    (b) Such donation(s) must have been made within the thirty-six (36)
        months preceding the date on which the Licensee first makes
        Commercial Use of the Software.

    (c) The Licensee must retain documentary evidence of the qualifying
        donation(s) (e.g., a charitable receipt, bank transfer record, or
        equivalent) and must provide such evidence to the copyright holders
        upon reasonable written request.

    (d) A single donation satisfies this requirement for all Commercial Use
        within the validity window defined in subsection (b). Subsequent
        uses that fall outside the validity window require a new qualifying
        donation.

4.3 Self-Certification.

    By exercising any right granted under this License for Commercial Use,
    the Licensee certifies that:
    (i)  it meets the eligibility requirements of Section 4.1; and
    (ii) it meets the eligibility requirements of Section 4.2.

    Providing false certification is a material breach of this License and
    results in immediate termination of all rights granted herein.

SECTION 5 — NON-RETROACTIVITY OF LICENSE AMENDMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1 Versioned Releases.

    Each publicly tagged or released version of the Software is permanently

    ("Covered Source"). The terms governing that Covered Source are fixed
    at the time of release.

5.2 Future License Versions.

    The copyright holders may publish revised or updated versions of this
    License in the future. Such revisions will carry a new version number
    (e.g., "Version 1.1", "Version 2.0").

5.3 Non-Retroactive Effect.

    A new or amended License Version applies only to versions of the
    Software released after the date on which the new License Version is
    published. No amendment to this License shall:
    (a) Retroactively alter the rights or obligations of any Licensee with
        respect to a Covered Source released under a prior License Version;
    (b) Invalidate or restrict any previously granted permission to use,
        modify, or distribute a Covered Source; or
    (c) Convert a past release from one License Version to another.

5.4 Licensee's Option on Future Releases.

    When a new License Version is published, a Licensee who has already
    accepted this License may elect to continue using any particular
    Covered Source under the License Version under which that Covered
    Source was released, or may choose to use future releases under the
    then-current License Version.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    action by the copyright holders.

8.2 Cure Period.

    If a Licensee becomes aware of an unintentional breach of Section 3
