# DeltaDatabase

> A lightweight, **encrypted-at-rest** JSON database written in Go — built for
> production-grade workloads that need per-entity encryption, JSON Schema
> validation, and a simple REST API.

## What is DeltaDatabase?

DeltaDatabase stores arbitrary **JSON documents** — called *entities* — inside named *databases*. Every entity is:

- **Validated** against a JSON Schema template before being persisted.
- **Encrypted** at rest using AES-256-GCM before touching disk.
- **Cached** in memory using a smart LRU policy for high-speed reads.
- **Accessed** through a plain HTTP REST API or gRPC from any language.

A built-in single-page web UI is served at `/` so you can browse and manage databases without any external tooling.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Encrypted at Rest
All entities are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being written to disk. The encryption key is managed exclusively by the Main Worker and never written to disk.

### 📋 Schema Validation
Define the shape of your data using JSON Schema (draft-07). Every write is validated before encryption — bad data is rejected before it reaches storage.

### ⚡ Smart Caching
An in-memory LRU cache means frequently-accessed entities are served without disk I/O. The cache is coherent across multiple Processing Workers.

### 🔌 Dual API
Access DeltaDatabase via REST (HTTP/JSON) or gRPC. The same data is accessible through either interface.

### 🌐 Built-in Web UI
A single-page management UI is embedded in the `main-worker` binary — no additional installation required.

### 📦 Flexible Storage
Choose between a shared POSIX filesystem (NFS, local) or any S3-compatible object store (MinIO, AWS S3, RustFS, SeaweedFS).

### 🚀 Horizontally Scalable
Add more Processing Workers behind the same Main Worker to increase throughput linearly.
